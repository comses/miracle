# Digging into Data: Mining relationships among variables in large datasets from complex systems
### Setup

We use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to organize MIRACLE's components. These consist of Docker
images for the following:

* Container for a Django uWSGI application server and Celery running under supervisord. We are
  aware that [Docker best practices](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) call
  for one process per container, but in the interests of expediency and limited development resources we've bundled
  Django and celery together for the interim. If you'd like to help split them out, please send us a PR!
* One container for an nginx reverse proxy
* Container for a modified version of the [Radiant](https://github.com/vnijs/radiant) business analytics Shiny app
* Container for [DeployR](https://deployr.revolutionanalytics.com/) that provides our R script execution environment

### First steps

* [Install the latest version of docker-compose and docker](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Create a local user named 'comses'. In order to handle file permissions on our shared volumes properly, make sure you
  create the user with a uid of 2000
* add yourself to the docker group

### Local development

* Copy `development.yml` to `docker-compose.yml`
* Copy and edit the Django settings files `cp django/miracle/settings/local.py.example django/miracle/settings/local.py` 
* Running `docker-compose build && docker-compose up django` will start a Django development server on port 8000

### Production configuration and deployment

* Copy `production.yml` to `docker-compose.yml` and edit the relevant environment variables for `MIRACLE_ADMIN`
* Copy SSL certs and private key into the nginx directory as `server.crt` and `server.key`, respectively

### Edit secrets manually
* Copy `deploy/deployr/deployr.conf.example` to `deploy/deployr/deployr.conf` and change the username / passwords
  so that the deployr container will create a custom user that can be accessed from Django.
* set matching postgresql user password in `deploy/db/init-db-user.sh` and `django/miracle/settings/local.py`

### Build the images and spin up the docker containers

* Build the images and start the containers via `% sh build.sh`
* In the future, you can start everything up via `docker-compose up -d` and take them down via `docker-compose down`
* The `miracle` homepage should be live at `https://localhost` at this point

### Loading Data

You can load the `luxedemo.packrat.tar.gz` and `rhea.packrat.tar.gz` from the
[miracle example projects github repository](https://github.com/comses/miracle-example-projects) via the command line by
downloading the `packrat.tar.gz` files into the `django` directory (this project's source tree is mapped to
/code/ in the Django container by default) and performing the following steps:

```
% docker-compose exec django bash # login to the container
% cd django;
% ./manage.py load_project luxedemo.packrat.tar.gz --creator=<username> --project=luxedemo
% ./manage.py load_project rhea.packrat.tar.gz --creator=<username> --project=rhea
```
